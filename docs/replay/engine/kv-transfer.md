# P/D KV transfer

In `mode: disaggregated`, each request is prefilled by a `prefill` worker and
then decoded by a `decode` worker. `engine.kv_transfer` sets how long moving the
prompt's KV cache between them takes. Add it to a disaggregated configuration
such as the [P/D example](README.md#a-complete-pd-example):

```yaml
engine:
  mode: disaggregated
  kv_transfer:
    bytes_per_token: auto
    bandwidth_gb_per_second: 50
    timing_mode: destination_missing
```

Omitting `kv_transfer` is the same as `{}`: the transfer happens with no delay.
A native ReplaySpec or Sweeper search space whose prefill rank sets a positive
`kv_transfer_bandwidth` without `kv_transfer_bytes_per_token` is rejected; the
YAML above always resolves the bytes.

## Transfer fields

| Knob | Default | Recommend | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `engine.kv_transfer.type` | `bandwidth` | fixed | `bandwidth` uses the scalar bandwidth below; `measured` obtains a bounded curve from the canonical prefill/decode performance models. The native engine stack currently supports measured Ascend GLM ModelSlim transfers. |
| `engine.kv_transfer.bytes_per_token` | `auto` | fixed | Positive integer or `auto`. Bytes moved per prompt token. `auto` derives it from the model and the prefill role's TP/PP/MoE shape. It can differ from either worker's `kv_cache.bytes_per_token`. With `state_cache`, `auto` uses the prefill role's resolved `kv_cache.bytes_per_token`. |
| `engine.kv_transfer.bandwidth_gb_per_second` | `null` | fixed | Positive, in decimal GB/s. `null` means no transfer delay, not a zero-bandwidth link. |
| `engine.kv_transfer.timing_mode` | `destination_missing` | fixed | `destination_missing` charges only the prompt KV the chosen decode worker does not already hold in its cache. `full_prompt` charges the whole prompt. |

All fields accept only concrete values; `recommend` does not search them.
`kv_transfer` is rejected in `aggregated` and `afd` modes.

With `type: measured`, keep `bytes_per_token: auto` and omit bandwidth. Both
language roles must use default canonical op-level timing on the same Ascend
hardware, SGLang version and local GLM ModelSlim model. The source and
destination attention TP select the actual sender/receiver mapping. The
qualified role layout is EP16/32, attention TP4/8/16, PP1/CP1/DCP1 and
128-token BF16 KV pages. Each selected attention-DP group must remain on one
node, with source and destination groups on different nodes. EP32 adds other
attention-DP groups; it does not change this request's replicated KV layout or
sender mapping. The same isolated-group curve therefore applies, while shared
link contention between groups remains uncalibrated.
The shared `estimator_config.op_level.ascend.kv_transfer_page_layout` selects
`contiguous` (default) or `fragmented`; both role configurations must agree.
The source model prepares the measured curve once and Replay shares it across
handoffs. Destination reservation and source KV retention keep their existing
ordering. Missing-token counts round up to 128-token pages, zero transfer is
free, and a query outside measured bounds fails without a bandwidth fallback.
The runtime records the selected mapping and measurement identity in transfer
provenance. Bootstrap, per-layer streaming and contention between requests
remain outside this calibration.

Each curve retains one collection identity and timing protocol. Publications
may select different complete curves from compatible campaigns to preserve
coverage. The selection uses measured ranges and point counts, never the
smallest latency; samples from different protocols are not spliced into a curve.

For `type: bandwidth`, transfer time in seconds is

```text
(transferred_tokens × bytes_per_token + state_bytes) / (bandwidth_gb_per_second × 10^9)
```

where `transferred_tokens` follows `timing_mode`. With
`destination_missing`, a decode worker that already caches a shared prefix
receives the request sooner, so prefix reuse on the decode side can lower TTFT
even when compute time does not change. `state_bytes` is the prefill role's
`state_cache.bytes_per_request` for
[hybrid-KV models](kv-cache.md#state-cache), and 0 otherwise.

## Request flow

1. The prefill worker runs the prompt and produces the first token.
2. The request is handed to a decode worker at the same virtual time. KV
   transfer starts, and the prefill worker's copy stays reserved until the
   transfer finishes.
3. After the transfer completes, the decode worker admits the request and
   generates the remaining tokens.

The reported TTFT includes prefill queueing, prefill compute and the transfer.
Transfer events share one virtual clock with compute and arrivals.

Backends order the handoff differently:

| Backend | Order |
| --- | --- |
| vLLM, TensorRT-LLM | Source-first: the prefill side finishes and then the decode side reserves space. |
| SGLang | Destination-first: the decode side reserves space before the transfer. |

TensorRT-LLM decode workers use `GUARANTEED_NO_EVICT` scheduling, which reserves
room for the whole output while transferred KV is held.

The two roles may use different `attention_data` sizes. A request moves from one
concrete prefill rank to one concrete decode rank. A trace request's
`prefill_dp_rank` chooses the prefill rank; if omitted, its `dp_rank` is used
for both roles.

## Limitations

- The transfer is a single request-level event. Per-layer streaming, KV
  layout conversion between different TP shapes, and network contention
  between concurrent transfers are not modeled.
- Bandwidth applies to each transfer independently.
- vLLM P/D can be combined with G2 host offload; see
  [KV cache](kv-cache.md#host-offload-g2). G3 offload is aggregated-only.
